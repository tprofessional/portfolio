                            <p>
                                My passion for computer science began in the
                            summer of 2015, as a soon-to-be sixth grader. I had
                            attended a two-week-long camp that introduced me to
                            programming in C as well as web development.
                            Since then, I have been working towards using my
                            problem solving skills to develop code in order to
                            solve problems or complete tasks that are important
                            and useful to me. I aim to be a professional software
                            developer or networks analyst in the future, so I try to
                            get as much hands-on experience as I can by joining clubs,
                            competing in CyberPatriot, taking online courses, 
                            and finding events like Hackathons and cyber Security
                            Capture the Flag challenges to participate in. I
                            enjoy programming because I am able to apply
                            both my logical and creative thinking into
                            developing code and implementing it into situations
                            where I am solving a practical problem.
                            <br><br>
                                My experiences with cyber security and developing 
                            programs have taught me the importance of collaboration,
                            patience, and persistence. Being on a CyberPatriot
                            team has helped me realize the importance of practice
                            when becoming well-versed in a subject. When I first
                            started, I did not have the slightest understanding 
                            of why it was necessary to secure digital devices, but
                            after reviewing information I found online, attending
                            college courses, and using practice images, I was
                            able to easily complete the challenges I was faced
                            with during the competitions. I learned that cooperation and
                            discussion was important for us to progress with
                            any ideas that we had in order to further develop
                            them into something tangible and practical. As it
                            was my first experience with cyber security, there were many
                            instances in which I felt confused and did not know
                            what I was supposed to be doing. To overcome this,
                            I asked for help from my mentors and teammates, who
                            were always willing to work together to resolve any issues
                            that came up. Currently, my team and I are competing
                            in CyberPatriot's Platinum Tier, an accomplishment I am
                            very proud of when I look back at where I started.
                            <br><br>
                            From these experiences, I learned valuable collaborative
                            skills such as effective communication and the ability to
                            ask for help when I need it. I apply the lessons I have
                            learned from facing challenges to my daily life, because
                            patience, practice, and the drive to learn are what 
                            allowed me to discover my passion for computer science
                            and cyber security. Thank you for your time. Please 
                            feel free to explore the rest of my portfolio.
