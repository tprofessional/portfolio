                            <p>
                                My passion for computer science began in the
                            summer of 2015, as a soon-to-be sixth grader. I had
                            attended a two-week-long camp that introduced me to
                            programming- specifically in C- and web development.
                            Since then, I have been working towards using my
                            problem solving skills to develop code in order to
                            solve problems or complete tasks that are important
                            and useful to me. I aim to be a professional software
                            developer or networks analyst in the future by
                            taking part in activities, clubs, and other events
                            that I can use and learn programming in with peers
                            who share similar interests as I do. The reason why
                            I have such an affinity for programming and learning
                            about digital networks is because I am able to apply
                            both my logical and creative thinking into
                            developing code and implementing it into situations
                            where I am solving a practical problem, or simply
                            entertaining my imagination.
                            <br><br>
                                Throughout my experiences in working with code
                            and developing web apps, I have noticed that
                            collaboration, patience, and persistence are all
                            essential skills to have. The first website I ever
                            contributed to developing was a project integrated
                            into the summer camp that introduced me to the world
                            of computer science. I had to work with three other
                            peers of varying experience to create a website for
                            a fake business of our choice. I learned that
                            cooperation and discussion was important for us to
                            progress with any ideas that we had and how to
                            further develop them into something tangible and
                            practical in regards to real-world problems. As it
                            was my first experience with code, there were many
                            instances in which I felt confused and did not know
                            what I was supposed to be doing. To overcome this,
                            I asked for help from my mentors and teammates, who
                            were always willing to work together to fix any
                            issues that had come up. In this way, patience,
                            along with persistence, was crucial in developing
                            the code that would be used in our final product.
                            <br><br>
                                By joining clubs, I was able to hone skills that
                            would helped me develop myself as a person, as well
                            as a programmer. The most helpful of these were the
                            Fallon Engineering Lab (FEL) that I was accepted to
                            in sixth grade, and the cyber security club I
                            founded in eighth grade. In joining FEL, I built and
                            programmed my first robot with guidance from coaches
                            and mentors and the assistance of my peers. From
                            these experiences, I learned leadership skills-
                            public speaking, communication, etc.- as well as
                            practical skills such as collaboration and
                            organization, which I find to be very useful not
                            only when generating code, but also in my daily life.
                            <br><br>
                                All in all, I have gained many skills from my
                            experiences with computer science and
                            engineering- whether it be programming, learning
                            cyber security, or building- that I continue to
                            use in everything that I do.
