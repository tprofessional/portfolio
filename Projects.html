                                        This project was my first coded game in Scratch. 
                                        During the two weeks my partner and I were given to 
                                        develop our project, we brainstormed ideas while trying 
                                        to decide what type of interactive program we wanted to
                                        create, wrote instructions, received feedback, organized
                                        our game, reflected on our final product, and logged our
                                        progress. Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FqA7TNIonMF6FcRiQnWg-9LDFCWWq9-fDz23juUnT4A/edit?usp=sharing"
                                        target="_blank">documentation</a>
                                        was created with the intent to look back at it and
                                        compare our work with any future ideas we had that
                                        required a similar developmental process. This project
                                        helped me develop an understanding of the fundamentals of using code to build a game, or
                                        any other type of program. Prior to beginning of the
                                        project, we were introduced to different types of
                                        variables and how they were used in professional coding
                                        to do different tasks. Difficulties in developing our
                                        program usually revolved around the limited types of
                                        blocks we were able to utilize, as we were sometimes
                                        puzzled about how to use the blocks to carry out a
                                        certain portion of our ideated function. In this project,
                                        me and my partner’s roles were split into Main Programmer
                                        and Main Notebooker. We agreed beforehand that I’d be in 
                                        charge of the documentation. Overall, my partner and I 
                                        worked well together; we shared our ideas, improved upon
                                        and fixed bugs in the code, and both contributed to the 
                                        documentation of the project.</p>
