                                    This project was my first coded game in Scratch. 
                                    During the two weeks my partner and I were given to 
                                    develop our project, we brainstormed ideas while trying 
                                    to decide what type of interactive program we wanted to
                                    create, wrote instructions, received feedback, organized
                                    our game, reflected on our final product, and logged our
                                    progress. Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TarBwiP1wahcMr786tMne9rpkqRPNbIY3tgFig6jzOc/edit?usp=sharing"
                                    target="_blank">documentation</a>
                                    was created with the intent to look back at it and
                                    compare our work with any future ideas we had that
                                    helped me develop an understanding of the fundamentals of using code to build a game, or
                                    any other type of program. Prior to beginning of the
                                    project, we were introduced to different types of
                                    variables and how they were used in professional coding
                                    to do different tasks. Difficulties in developing our
                                    program usually revolved around the limited types of
                                    blocks we were able to utilize, as we were sometimes
                                    puzzled about how to use the blocks to carry out a
                                    certain portion of our ideated function. In this project,
                                    me and my partner’s roles were split into Main Programmer
                                    and Main Notebooker. We agreed beforehand that I’d be in 
                                    charge of the documentation. Overall, my partner and I 
                                    and fixed bugs in the code, and both contributed to the 
                                    documentation of the project.

                                    During this project, we used Python to write
                                    a program that would allow a client to modify
                                    a set of images. Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zQhgOopOlVIp-woJ9Y2b6If_P7oTy8-4HJ1uAMOh-eE/edit?usp=sharing"
                                    target="_blank">documentation</a> of the development
                                    of our program helped us keep track of what 
                                    we were working on and what to improve upon. 
                                    Prior to the project, we learned about masks
                                    and how to modify the RGB values of a pixel.
                                    Using this knowledge, we came up with a 
                                    program that could add borders of different 
                                    shapes to an image, as well as asking the user
                                    for input on the modification of the border's 
                                    color and shape.
