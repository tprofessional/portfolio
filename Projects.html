                                    This project was my first coded game in Scratch. 
                                    During the two weeks my partner and I were given to 
                                    develop our project, we brainstormed ideas while trying 
                                    to decide what type of interactive program we wanted to
                                    create, wrote instructions, received feedback, organized
                                    our game, reflected on our final product, and logged our
                                    progress. Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X2XKxy_WejtCBrPV_P6t64PCMYIV7WsYdvAtlp9hGk0/edit?usp=sharing"
                                    target="_blank">documentation</a>
                                    was created with the intent to look back at it and
                                    compare our work with any future ideas we had that
                                    helped me develop an understanding of the fundamentals of using code to build a game, or
                                    any other type of program. Prior to beginning of the
                                    project, we were introduced to different types of
                                    variables and how they were used in professional coding
                                    to do different tasks. Difficulties in developing our
                                    program usually revolved around the limited types of
                                    blocks we were able to utilize, as we were sometimes
                                    puzzled about how to use the blocks to carry out a
                                    certain portion of our ideated function. In this project,
                                    me and my partner’s roles were split into Main Programmer
                                    and Main Notebooker. We agreed beforehand that I’d be in 
                                    charge of the documentation. Overall, my partner and I 
                                    and fixed bugs in the code, and both contributed to the 
                                    documentation of the project.

                                    During this project, we used Python to write
                                    a program that would allow a client to modify
                                    a set of images. Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y-VkZb08nd5mg6dBSDeE5Y3Xwr3MWf7AswYRgI3m8ig/edit?usp=sharing"
                                    target="_blank">documentation</a> of the development
                                    of our program helped us keep track of what 
                                    we were working on and what to improve upon. 
                                    Prior to the project, we learned about masks
                                    and how to modify the RGB values of a pixel.
                                    Using this knowledge, we came up with a 
                                    program that could add borders of different 
                                    shapes to an image, as well as asking the user
                                    for input on the modification of the border's 
                                    color and shape.

                                <p>
                                    The objective of this project was to create four prototype
                                    vehicles that would each have one unique power configuration
                                    using solar cells and hydrogen fuel cells. My role in 
                                    the project was mainly designing and building the vehicle.
                                    I also helped update the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRSaeAnde_MWYt5uTbzQz5Q3C2BZZ8m8Rbu1pJJwJf4/edit?usp=sharing"
                                    target="_blank">documentation</a> so that we could easily
                                    keep track of our design iterations. During our brainstorming
                                    process for the design of the cars, I proposed the basic design
                                    of the vehicle, which would have one platform as the body, four
                                    same-sized wheels, and some vertical reinforcements to keep
                                    the power cells from sliding while the vehicle moves. This project
                                    helped me focus on my building skills and how to improve build quality
                                    for optimal performance. I also improved my technical writing skills by
                                    contributing to the write-up and recommendation to our client for which car
                                    proved to be the most ideal in terms of efficiency and speed.

                                    The goal of this project was to use a decision 
                                    matrix to select and modify a single bridge 
                                    design using the West Point Bridge Designer 
                                    software. The final bridge had a budget limit of 
                                    $300,000 and needed to be able to support weight 
                                    by distributing tensile and compression forces 
                                    throughout its members. My primary roles in this 
                                    project were to develop 2 initial designs, update 
                                    and write thorough <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nBDrzWQE1SdZ7SWZZwHkvj6Xo5CrbnhSgNi66qlnDmc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a>, and improve the 
                                    final design my partner and I selected. Of the four 
                                    total initial designs my partner and I came up with, 
                                    a design I developed, Design 2B, fit our ideal 
                                    criteria the most. I used a decision matrix to 
                                    further improve Design 2B so that it would be less 
                                    costly and better able to distribute tensile and 
                                    compressive forces. The decision matrix was an 
                                    important part of this project because it defined 
                                    the characteristics of the final proposal for our 
                                    bridge design. This helped me improve my descriptive 
                                    writing in documentation because we needed to be 
                                    specific when identifying the characteristics of 
                                    the bridge we had improved in our final design.
