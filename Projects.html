                                    This project was my first coded game in Scratch. 
                                    During the two weeks my partner and I were given to 
                                    develop our project, we brainstormed ideas while trying 
                                    to decide what type of interactive program we wanted to
                                    create, wrote instructions, received feedback, organized
                                    our game, reflected on our final product, and logged our
                                    progress. Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X2XKxy_WejtCBrPV_P6t64PCMYIV7WsYdvAtlp9hGk0/edit?usp=sharing"
                                    target="_blank">documentation</a>
                                    was created with the intent to look back at it and
                                    compare our work with any future ideas we had that
                                    helped me develop an understanding of the fundamentals of using code to build a game, or
                                    any other type of program. Prior to beginning of the
                                    project, we were introduced to different types of
                                    variables and how they were used in professional coding
                                    to do different tasks. Difficulties in developing our
                                    program usually revolved around the limited types of
                                    blocks we were able to utilize, as we were sometimes
                                    puzzled about how to use the blocks to carry out a
                                    certain portion of our ideated function. In this project,
                                    me and my partner’s roles were split into Main Programmer
                                    and Main Notebooker. We agreed beforehand that I’d be in 
                                    charge of the documentation. Overall, my partner and I 
                                    and fixed bugs in the code, and both contributed to the 
                                    documentation of the project.

                                    During this project, we used Python to write
                                    a program that would allow a client to modify
                                    a set of images. Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y-VkZb08nd5mg6dBSDeE5Y3Xwr3MWf7AswYRgI3m8ig/edit?usp=sharing"
                                    target="_blank">documentation</a> of the development
                                    of our program helped us keep track of what 
                                    we were working on and what to improve upon. 
                                    Prior to the project, we learned about masks
                                    and how to modify the RGB values of a pixel.
                                    Using this knowledge, we came up with a 
                                    program that could add borders of different 
                                    shapes to an image, as well as asking the user
                                    for input on the modification of the border's 
                                    color and shape.

                                    The objective of this project was to create four prototype
                                    vehicles that would each have one unique power configuration
                                    using solar cells and hydrogen fuel cells. My role in 
                                    the project was mainly designing and building the vehicle.
                                    I also helped update the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRSaeAnde_MWYt5uTbzQz5Q3C2BZZ8m8Rbu1pJJwJf4/edit?usp=sharing"
                                    target="_blank">documentation</a> so that we could easily
                                    keep track of our design iterations. During our brainstorming
                                    process for the design of the cars, I proposed the basic design
                                    of the vehicle, which would have one platform as the body, four
                                    same-sized wheels, and some vertical reinforcements to keep
                                    the power cells from sliding while the vehicle moves. This project
                                    helped me focus on my building skills and how to improve build quality
                                    for optimal performance. I also improved my technical writing skills by
                                    contributing to the write-up and recommendation to our client for which car
                                    proved to be the most ideal in terms of efficiency and speed.

                                    The goal of this project was to use a decision 
                                    matrix to select and modify a single bridge 
                                    design using the West Point Bridge Designer 
                                    software. The final bridge had a budget limit of 
                                    $300,000 and needed to be able to support weight 
                                    by distributing tensile and compression forces 
                                    throughout its members. My primary roles in this 
                                    project were to develop 2 initial designs, update 
                                    and write thorough <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nBDrzWQE1SdZ7SWZZwHkvj6Xo5CrbnhSgNi66qlnDmc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a>, and improve the 
                                    final design my partner and I selected. Of the four 
                                    total initial designs my partner and I came up with, 
                                    a design I developed, Design 2B, fit our ideal 
                                    criteria the most. I used a decision matrix to 
                                    further improve Design 2B so that it would be less 
                                    costly and better able to distribute tensile and 
                                    compressive forces. The decision matrix was an 
                                    important part of this project because it defined 
                                    the characteristics of the final proposal for our 
                                    bridge design. This helped me improve my descriptive 
                                    writing in documentation because we needed to be 
                                    specific when identifying the characteristics of 
                                    the bridge we had improved in our final design.

                                    The goal of this project was to use Greenfoot to 
                                    contribute to a virtual seating chart. The requirements
                                    were to use an image to represent ourselves sitting
                                    and standing and to switch to standing when we get called
                                    (clicked on) for attendance. We also had to make an 
                                    animation with ourselves and include the audio element 
                                    of us saying our names. After I forked the repository,
                                    I needed to write the code locally and then push it to my
                                    cloned repository. This project helped me develop my 
                                    skills using GitHub and I became more familiar with the 
                                    commands needed to push, pull, merge, and commit different
                                    versions of my program files. I got familiar with the Greenfoot
                                    interface and its functionality. As this was a collaborative project,
                                    I worked with my teammates to test our seating chart contributions 
                                    in a separate folder and formatted it similarly to the final project 
                                    this testing helped us fix any bugs that we wouldn't have seen
                                    if we had just contributed directly to the final project (placements,
                                    positioning parameters, etc.).

                                    The goal of this project was to use Java to create an
                                    educational game which taught on a specific subject.
                                    Our group chose to teach general topics of astronomy. 
                                    My primary roles in this project were to lead the team 
                                    in programming the game, compiling the code from each 
                                    member into a single project folder, and help organize 
                                    our timeline. I also contributed to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bpyRNXz_daboYm44woW9KAQnVoPMprtLw3CQ5i2MCus/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a> 
                                    by annotating our program files to explain each class's
                                    function. We applied a milestone chart to our organization
                                    of the project to determine how long each task would need. 
                                    The milestone chart was helpful because we could assign 
                                    specific tasks to each group member and hold them accountable 
                                    if we didn't see progress on the task. This project also 
                                    reinforced my learning of how to use Git Bash because there were 
                                    certain conflicts within the remote and local repositories 
                                    because the two branches could not be merged at one point and 
                                    I needed to learn how to create a temporary branch to resolve 
                                    the conflict.

                                <p>
                                    This <a href="https://replit.com/@tprofessional/StarDataReader#StarInfo.java" target="_blank">project</a>
                                    built on the topics covered in the PLTW DATA Lab and required that we use arraylists and 
                                    the Sinbad library to read and process data. During this project, I learned how to find 
                                    data on Kaggle and how to process data using Sinbad and the Java DataSource interface. 
                                    We used a .csv file and the DataSource interface to load the data. For this project, we 
                                    also had to incorporate our past knowledge of creating classes and constructors to assign 
                                    each data entry to a Star object of our own Star class. In our class file, we created 
                                    accessor, or getter methods to return each attribute of a Star object that was relevant 
                                    to the purpose of our program. Our program would ultimately ask the user if they wanted 
                                    to know the information of the hottest or coldest star in the dataset, and would then 
                                    return the appropriate attributes of that star. To do this, we needed to use our accessor 
                                    methods to return the temperature of a Star, and then use the DataSource fetchList() method 
                                    so that we could iterate through an array of all the stars in the dataset and find the 
                                    one with either the highest or lowest temperaature (depending on which one the user wanted 
                                    to find).
