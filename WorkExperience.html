                                    During my time in the engineering academy, I have met with industry professionals through 
                                    workplace field trips and guest speakers. Connecting with these industry professionals 
                                    has helped me narrow my focus on the career path I am most interested in. Hearing about 
                                    their work, internship, and college experience is helpful because I learn the most efficient 
                                    and useful ways to apply for programs and courses that are relevant to my ideal career and 
                                    collegiate experiences.

                                    Maynard Holiday is a Senior Tech Advisor to the US government and he told us about his work 
                                    in infrastructure. One of the projects he worked on was working on the Chernobyl reactors 
                                    after it exploded in 1986. To observe the aftermath without exposing oneself to the high 
                                    levels of radiation at the site, Maynard described how scientists used IBM robots to take video 
                                    footage of the area and would analyze it remotely.

                                    Being interested in artificial intelligence, one of the guest speaker presentations I found 
                                    most interesting was a presentation by Jason Yosinski, founder of Uber AI Labs. During this 
                                    presentation, I learned more about the concept of machine learning and how machine learning 
                                    programs “write themselves” after conducting multiple trials. Since this presentation, I 
                                    have searched for opportunities and workshops to learn more about AI.

                                    During this presentation, Lars Borg and Tom Shefler covered the topics of how the Moon was 
                                    formed, as well as what kind of methods of dating were used to determine the evolution of 
                                    the Earth and Moon after their separation. I found this lecture interesting and relevant 
                                    because it connects to what we have learned in class about the design process, specifically 
                                    about constructing and testing a prototype. In the case of determining the age of the Moon, 
                                    the first model used to do so can be considered a prototype, and the testing of this prototype 
                                    was using a modified method of using half-lives to redate the rocks.

                                    In this talk, Dr. Coleman, Dr. Frank, Dr. Loftus, and Ms. McKay addressed medical concerns with 
                                    sending astronauts to Mars. These included the amount of time and distance needed to travel to 
                                    Mars, how to stay healthy on the way to and on Mars, and what kind of technology would be most 
                                    suited for assessing the health of astronauts traveling in deep space. Emphasis was placed on 
                                    how each team member working to produce the medical device had to communicate clearly and 
                                    effectively with others because of the nature of the product and because teams were made up 
                                    of professionals in different fields (chemistry, biology, engineering). This talk gave me 
                                    insight into the development process of medical devices, but not just those that would be used 
                                    normally, but ones that would have to function outside the Earth's atmosphere.

                                    I recently participated in a job-shadow field trip to Roche labs. During this job-shadow, 
                                    I toured the different facilities used for each type of job at Roche, gained advice from 
                                    mentors, and discovered how the work environment at Roche is maintained. The most valuable 
                                    experience during this field trip was being able to talk with employees at Roche about 
                                    essential skills needed for their work. During the Q&A session with mentors, I was able to 
                                    talk to Dr. Persis Wadia, who works in Research and Development. She spoke about the 
                                    importance of writing precise and thorough documentation for diagnostic products being 
                                    developed. I found this skill to be relevant to my own career goals because, with my 
                                    experiences in courses including Computer Science Principles and Principles of Engineering, 
                                    I realize that documentation is an important part of every engineering project. 
                                    Additionally, I met Dr. Iqbal Zahidi, Director of Operations at Roche. I gained valuable 
                                    advice about what to put on a resume when applying for a job, and that a resume should 
                                    showcase what you can provide for the company you apply to.
