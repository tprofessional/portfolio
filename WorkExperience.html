                                During my time in the engineering academy, I have met with industry professionals through 
                                workplace field trips and guest speakers. Connecting with these industry professionals 
                                has helped me narrow my focus on the career path I am most interested in. Hearing about 
                                their work, internship, and college experience is helpful because I learn the most efficient 
                                and useful ways to apply for programs and courses that are relevant to my ideal career and 
                                collegiate experiences.

                                I recently participated in a job-shadow field trip to Roche labs. During this job-shadow, 
                                I toured the different facilities used for each type of job at Roche, gained advice from 
                                mentors, and discovered how the work environment at Roche is maintained. The most valuable 
                                experience during this field trip was being able to talk with employees at Roche about 
                                essential skills needed for their work. During the Q&A session with mentors, I was able to 
                                talk to Dr. Persis Wadia, who works in Research and Development. She spoke about the 
                                importance of writing precise and thorough documentation for diagnostic products being 
                                developed. I found this skill to be relevant to my own career goals because, with my 
                                experiences in courses including Computer Science Principles and Principles of Engineering, 
                                I realize that documentation is an important part of every engineering project. 
                                Additionally, I met Dr. Iqbal Zahidi, Director of Operations at Roche. I gained valuable 
                                advice about what to put on a resume when applying for a job, and that a resume should 
                                showcase what you can provide for the company you apply to.

                                Being interested in artificial intelligence, one of the guest speaker presentations I found 
                                most interesting was a presentation by Jason Yosinski, founder of Uber AI Labs. During this 
                                presentation, I learned more about the concept of machine learning and how machine learning 
                                programs “write themselves” after conducting multiple trials. Since this presentation, I 
                                have searched for opportunities and workshops to learn more about AI.
